# Beakball
Pidgeon Feeding Simulator

Click anywhere to drop random sized crumbs.
Pidgeons will rush towards them and peck them with their beaks.
If the crumb is too big, pidgeons will tear it apart, throwing it at random direction and eating only small parts that fit in their beaks.

Inspired by the real game of beakball which pidgeons like to play worldwide.
